description: A Helm chart for ${appName}

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: ${version}

# This is the version number of the application being deployed. This version number should be
# incremented each time you make changes to the application. Versions are not expected to
# follow Semantic Versioning. They should reflect the version the application is using.
# It is recommended to use it with quotes.
appVersion: "1.0.0"

# To include an aiSSEMBLE chart with ArgoCD we must add it as a dependency until including from multiple sources
# is moved out of beta and into the latest version of Argo.
# https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/
# Note that this requires prefixing values with the name of the dependency (see test/src/test/resources in the aiSSEMBLE repo
# for example usage) in order to override values.
