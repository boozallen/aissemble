_Step 1: Instantiate a New aiSSEMBLE Project:_ The aiSSEMBLE archetype is an executable pattern that can quickly incept
a project that is ready to leverage aiSSEMBLE for constructing components tailored to your needs. It is realized below
using a Maven archetype feature.

== Use a Maven Archetype to Create a New Project
The first step in creating a new project is to leverage Maven's archetype functionality to incept a new Maven project 
that will contain all of your aiSSEMBLE component implementations - data delivery and machine learning pipelines as well as
path to production modules.

Open a terminal to the location in which you want your project to live and execute the following command:
[source]
[subs=attributes+]

ifeval::[{is-pre-release} == true]
-- 
mvn archetype:generate \
	-DarchetypeGroupId=com.boozallen.aissemble \
	-DarchetypeArtifactId=foundation-archetype \
	-DarchetypeVersion={page-version}-SNAPSHOT
--
endif::[]

ifeval::[{is-pre-release} != true]
-- 
mvn archetype:generate \
	-DarchetypeGroupId=com.boozallen.aissemble \
	-DarchetypeArtifactId=foundation-archetype \
	-DarchetypeVersion={page-version}
--
endif::[]

This command will trigger an interactive questionnaire giving you the opportunity to enter the following information contained in the below table.

*  This information can also be provided without interaction by including ``-D<propertyName>=<propertyValue>`` for each
property you want to manually set when running the ``mvn archetype:generate`` command.
* Some of the information required (such as ``archetypeVersion``) is unavailable in interactive mode. For these
properties, you can use the above Maven command to include them.

.Archetype Options
[cols="1a,2a,3a,2a,5a"]
|===
| Value | Description | Guidance | Example(s) | Interactive

| ``archetypeVersion``
| Use an archetype from a specific aiSSEMBLE release
|
Typically, developers should target the most recently released archetype. In appropriate circumstances, it is possible to target a pre-release https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#what-is-a-snapshot-version[snapshot version,role=external,window=_blank] by using the -SNAPSHOT suffix.

|
* 0.11.0
* 0.9.8
* 0.12.0-SNAPSHOT
| No

| ``artifactId``
| The folder name as well as module name of your project root
| A generic description of the project or set of pipelines that will be included in the project. Maven conventions
suggest the use of a dash to separate terms.
|
* ``payment-analytics``
* ``charge-off-prediction``
* ``rdec`` (example of a project acronym)
| Yes

| ``groupId``
| The namespace in which your Maven modules will live
| In general, you want it to think about ``groupId`` like the notional reverse ordered internet address of your effort.
General pattern: ``<internet domain name in reverse>.<your area name>``

| Examples:

* ``com.boozallen.aissemble``
* ``mil.navy.blueangels.ridealong``

| Yes

| ``package``
| The package name in which JVM-based source code will be placed
| Defaults to your ``groupId`` value, which is almost always the right decision, so just select enter to accept this
default
| See ``groupId`` examples above
| Yes

| ``projectDescription``
| General description of your project
| Default to "Project that contains aiSSEMBLE compliant pipeline(s)"
|
| No

| ``licenseName``
| The name of the license to use in the project
| Defaults to Booz Allen's "closed-source-license" but can be updated to a
https://github.com/boozallen/booz-allen-maven-licenses[Booz Allen license,role=external,window=_blank] or any license
under mvn license:license-list
|
* booz-allen-public-license
* agpl_v3

| No

| ``projectGitUrl``
| The git URL of the project
| The git URL of the project, without the `.git` suffix
|


| Yes

| ``projectName``
| A short, human-readable version name of the project
| The human readable version of your ``artifactId``
|

* aiSSEMBLE
* NAVY BA Ride Along

| Yes

| ``version``
| The name of the current version
| Generally recommended to follow a ``<major version>.<minor version>.<patch version>`` convention. If you don't have a
strong opinion, start at ``1.0.0-SNAPSHOT``. ``1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`` is the default when instantiating a new project.

Maven has inherent support for "development" versions. This helps projects manage in flight versus released software.
Using https://github.com/TechnologyBrewery/habushu[Habushu,role=external,window=_blank], python modules are able to
easily and automatically follow this Snapshot pattern as well (where ``-SNAPSHOT`` will be inferred to ``.dev``).
|
* ``1.0.0-SNAPSHOT``
* ``1.1.0-SNAPSHOT``

| No

|===

Once you enter these values, the archetype will ask you to confirm your entries. You now have a Maven project in which 
you can setup your specific pipelines, as described in the next step.
