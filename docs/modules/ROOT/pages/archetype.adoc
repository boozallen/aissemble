_Step 1: Instantiate a New aiSSEMBLE Project:_ The aiSSEMBLE archetype is an executable pattern that can quickly incept
a project that is ready to leverage aiSSEMBLE for constructing components tailored to your needs. It is realized below
using a Maven archetype feature.

== Use a Maven Archetype to Create a New Project
The first step in creating a new project is to leverage Maven's archetype functionality to incept a new Maven project 
that will contain all of your aiSSEMBLE component implementations - data delivery and machine learning pipelines as well as
path to production modules.

Open a terminal to the location in which you want your project to live and execute the following command:
[source]
[subs=attributes+]

ifeval::[{is-pre-release} == true]
-- 
mvn archetype:generate \
	-DarchetypeGroupId=com.boozallen.aissemble \
	-DarchetypeArtifactId=foundation-archetype \
	-DarchetypeVersion={page-version}-SNAPSHOT
--
endif::[]

ifeval::[{is-pre-release} != true]
-- 
mvn archetype:generate \
	-DarchetypeGroupId=com.boozallen.aissemble \
	-DarchetypeArtifactId=foundation-archetype \
	-DarchetypeVersion={page-version}
--
endif::[]

This command will trigger an interactive questionnaire giving you the opportunity to enter the following information
contained in the below table.

*  This information can also be provided without interaction by including ``-D<propertyName>=<propertyValue>`` for each
property you want to manually set when running the ``mvn archetype:generate`` command.
* Some of the information required (such as ``archetypeVersion``) is unavailable in interactive mode. For these
properties, you can use the above Maven command to include them.

.Archetype Options
[cols="2a,3a,3a,2a,1a"]
|===
| Value | Description | Guidance | Example(s) | Interactive

| ``archetypeVersion``
| Use an archetype from a specific aiSSEMBLE release
|
Typically, developers should target the most recently released archetype. In appropriate circumstances, it is possible
to target a pre-release https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#what-is-a-snapshot-version[snapshot
version,role=external,window=_blank] by using the -SNAPSHOT suffix.

|
* 0.11.0
* 0.9.8
* 0.12.0-SNAPSHOT
| No

| ``artifactId``
| The folder name as well as module name of your project root
| A generic description of the project or set of pipelines that will be included in the project. Maven conventions
suggest the use of a dash to separate terms.
|
* ``payment-analytics``
* ``charge-off-prediction``
* ``rdec`` (example of a project acronym)
| Yes

| ``dockerProjectRepositoryUrl``
| The name of the custom docker repository to use for this project.
| Should be specified and utilized with the https://github.com/TechnologyBrewery/orphedomos[orphedomos-maven-plugin] to
build and push docker images.

Please see https://github.com/TechnologyBrewery/orphedomos?tab=readme-ov-file#repository-url[Orphedomos's documentation on
repository URLs,role=external,window=_blank]. The https://github.com/TechnologyBrewery/orphedomos?tab=readme-ov-file#repository-id[Repository ID]
should also be set and match a serverId entry in your settings.xml that holds credentials for the docker login.

If not specified, this will default to `docker-registry-PLACEHOLDER/repository` and will need to be updated in your root
`pom.xml` file prior to pushing your first docker image.
|
* `docker.io/mydomain/repository`
* `ghcr.io/mydomain/repository`

| No

| ``groupId``
| The namespace in which your Maven modules will live
| In general, you want it to think about ``groupId`` like the notional reverse ordered internet address of your effort.
General pattern: ``<internet domain name in reverse>.<your area name>``

| Examples:

* ``com.boozallen.aissemble``
* ``mil.navy.blueangels.ridealong``

| Yes

| ``licenseName``
| The name of the license to use in the project
| Defaults to Booz Allen's "closed-source-license" but can be updated to a
https://github.com/boozallen/booz-allen-maven-licenses[Booz Allen license,role=external,window=_blank] or any license
under mvn license:license-list
|
* booz-allen-public-license
* agpl_v3

| No

| ``mavenRepositoryUrl``
|  The URL of the Maven repository where the release artifacts of the project will be deployed.
| Defaults to `https://release-PLACEHOLDER/repository/maven-releases` and can be updated in the `<properties>` section
of the root `pom.xml`
|
* `https://nexus.mydomain.com/repository/maven-releases/`
* `https://artifactory.mydomain.com/artifactory/libs-release-local`

| No

| ``mavenSnapshotRepositoryUrl``
|  The URL of the Maven repository where the snapshot artifacts of the project will be deployed.
| Defaults to `https://snapshot-PLACEHOLDER/repository/maven-snapshots` and can be updated in the `<properties>` section
of the root `pom.xml`
|
* `https://nexus.mydomain.com/repository/maven-snapshots/`
* `https://artifactory.mydomain.com/artifactory/libs-snapshot-local`

| No

| ``package``
| The package name in which JVM-based source code will be placed
| Defaults to your ``groupId`` value, which is almost always the right decision, so just select enter to accept this
default
| See ``groupId`` examples above
| Yes

| ``projectDescription``
| General description of your project
| Default to "Project that contains aiSSEMBLE compliant pipeline(s)"
|
| No

| ``projectGitUrl``
| The git URL of the project
| The git URL of the project, without the `.git` suffix
|


| Yes

| ``projectName``
| A short, human-readable version name of the project
| The human readable version of your ``artifactId``
|

* aiSSEMBLE
* NAVY BA Ride Along

| Yes

| ``version``
| The name of the current version
| Generally recommended to follow a ``<major version>.<minor version>.<patch version>`` convention. If you don't have a
strong opinion, start at ``1.0.0-SNAPSHOT``. ``1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`` is the default when instantiating a new project.

Maven has inherent support for "development" versions. This helps projects manage in flight versus released software.
Using https://github.com/TechnologyBrewery/habushu[Habushu,role=external,window=_blank], python modules are able to
easily and automatically follow this Snapshot pattern as well (where ``-SNAPSHOT`` will be inferred to ``.dev``).
|
* ``1.0.0-SNAPSHOT``
* ``1.1.0-SNAPSHOT``

| No

| `pypiProjectRepositoryUrl`
| The name of the custom PyPI repository to use for this project.
| Should be used if you have Python modules and intend to publish your project's PyPI artifacts to a private repository,
such as Nexus or Artifactory.  If you plan to use the public https://pypi.org repository, you can explicitly set that
here as well.

Please see https://github.com/TechnologyBrewery/habushu?tab=readme-ov-file#pypirepoid[Habushu's documentation on
repository URLs,role=external,window=_blank], including how to leverage `settings.xml` to pass in credentials
for these repositories. These instructions also cover URL configuration for specific PyPI repository types (e.g.,
upload and download url specialization) as well as how to also configure a separate release and development PyPI URL,
if desired.

If not specified, this will default to `https://pypi-PLACEHOLDER/repository/` and will need to be updated in your root
`pom.xml` file prior to pushing your first PyPI artifacts to a repository.
|
* `https://nexus.mydomain.com/repository/x-pypi`
* `https://artifactory.mydomain.com/repository/y-pypi`
* `https://pypi.org`

| No
| `helmPublishingRepositoryUrl`
| The URL of the Helm repository you plan to publish your Helm charts to for this project.
| Should be used if you intend to publish your project's Helm charts to a private repository,
such as Nexus or ghcr.io.

Please see https://github.com/kokuwaio/helm-maven-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file#helm-maven-plugin[helm-maven-plugin documentation,role=external,window=_blank], to view further configurations that can be set for your Helm repository specifications.

If not specified, this will default to `https://helm-PLACEHOLDER/repository` and will need to be updated in your root
`pom.xml` file prior to pushing your Helm charts to a repository.
|
* `https://nexus.mydomain.com/repository`
* `https://ghcr.io/mydomain/repository`

| No
| `helmPublishingRepositoryName`
| The name of the Helm repository you plan to publish your Helm charts to for this project.

Once you enter these values, the archetype will ask you to confirm your entries. You now have a Maven project in which 
you can setup your specific pipelines, as described in the next step.
