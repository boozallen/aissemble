= Path to Production

aiSSEMBLE(TM) generates several artifacts to help drive consistency, repeatability, and quality of delivery. These
artifacts are designed as starting points for a mature DevOps-centric approach for delivering high-quality AI systems
and are not intended as complete solutions in and of themselves.

_Path to Production_: Many AI systems are developed across the industry leverage ad-hoc, manual processes - a Data Engineer or
Data Scientist exports local code via a container and pushes that into production. This practice was once rampant in
software development as well. Over time, it has become an industry best practice to leverage automation to establish a
repeatable, consistent _path to production_ to ensure quality and enable higher-velocity delivery.  It's critical to
recognize that while slower for an initial deployment, the speed and repeatability of this process are amongst the
most important enablers in enabling the an effort to movie fast over time (an attribute most clients revere as it
allows ongoing responsiveness and impact for their customers).

== Containers

When generating a Docker module aiSSEMBLE generates not only the Dockerfile, but also the relevant Kubernetes manifest
files. See xref:containers.adoc[Container Support] for more details.

== CI/CD

Every project is incepted with a devops folder that contains configurations for
https://plugins.jenkins.io/templating-engine/[Jenkins Templating Engine,role=external,window=_blank]. The generated
templates leverage libraries from https://boozallen.github.io/sdp-docs/sdp-libraries/index.html[Solutions Delivery
Platform,role=external,window=_blank] that build the project and send notifications to a configured Slack channel.
See xref:ci-cd.adoc[CI/CD Support] for more details.
