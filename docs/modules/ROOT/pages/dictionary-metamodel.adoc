= Dictionary Metamodel

Dictionary metamodels specify semantically-rich types on which records can be based. Doing so creates a set of 
consistent, reusable type definitions that help enforce commonality across the system. For more information about data
records, see the xref:semantic-data.adoc#_semantic_data[Semantic Data] page.

== Dictionary Metamodel Specifications

Each metadata instance should be placed in a file with the same name as your dictionary that lives within the following
directory structure (to initially create this structure, please see xref:archetype.adoc[]):

`<project-name>/<project-name>-pipeline-models/src/main/resources/dictionaries`

For example:

`test-project/test-project-pipeline-models/src/main/resources/dictionaries/IrsDictionary.json`

=== Dictionary Root Element Options

|===
| Element Name | Required? | Default | Use

| `name`

UpperCamelCase/PascalCase notation (e.g., `IrsDictionary.json`).

| `package`
