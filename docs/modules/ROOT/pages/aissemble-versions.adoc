= Release Notes

Each version of the aiSSEMBLE(TM) project will be accompanied by release notes detailing the major additions and breaking
changes contained in that release.  These release notes are available on the aiSSEMBLE GitHub project's
https://github.com/boozallen/aissemble/releases[Releases page,role=external,window=_blank].

## Preview of Next Release

Given the fragile nature of GitHub Release Notes (no version control), we track our in-flight changes in a versioned
document within the codebase.  Check out https://github.com/boozallen/aissemble/blob/dev/DRAFT_RELEASE_NOTES.md[DRAFT
Release Notes,role=external,window=_blank] to see what's coming in the next release.
