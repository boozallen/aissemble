= Record Metamodel

Record metamodels specify semantically-rich line items on which pipelines can be based. This approach
allows many labor-intensive and tedious coding activities to be generated based on declarative model definitions. It 
also allows the consistent generation of the same concept across multiple languages (e.g. Python, Java, Scala). For
more information about data  records, see the xref:semantic-data.adoc#_semantic_data[Semantic Data] page.

== Record Metamodel Specifications

Each metadata instance should be placed in a file with the same name as your record that lives within the following
directory structure (to initially create this structure, please see xref:archetype.adoc[]):

`<project-name>/<project-name>-pipeline-models/src/main/resources/records`

For example:

`test-project/test-project-pipeline-models/src/main/resources/records/TaxPayer.json`

=== Record Root Element Options
The following options are available on the root record element:

.Record Root Metamodel Options
[cols="2a,1a,1a,4a"]
|===
| Element Name | Required? | Default | Use

| `name`
| Yes
| None
| Specifies the name of your record. It should represent the functional concept of your record and must use 
UpperCamelCase/PascalCase notation (e.g., `TaxPayer.json`).

| `title`
| No
| Value of name option
| Specifies the display name of your record. It can be used when `name` does not present well in external systems (e.g.,
‘A Record Name’ reads better than ‘ARecordName’). If no value is specified, it will default to `name`.

| `package`
| Yes
| None
| Provides a namespace that will be leveraged to differentiate between instances and provide language-specific 
namespacing (e.g., package in Java, namespace in XSD).

| `description`
| No
| None
| A description of the record being specified.

| `dataAccess` (xref:#_data_access_options[details])
| No
| Yes
| By default, xref:data-access-details.adoc[data access] is enabled for the record. Specifying this element allows for
data access to be disabled or enabled, if desired.

| `frameworks`
| No
| None
| A list of frameworks to extend base record capabilities. For example, modifying Python records to include
PySpark support methods.

| `fields` (xref:#_record_field_options[details])
| Yes
| None
| A list of fields in your record. At least one field is required within `fields`.

|===
| Element Name | Required? | Default | Use

| `fields/field/name`
| Yes
| None
| The name of the field that is being modeled and must use UpperCamelCase/PascalCase notation. (e.g.,
`SocialSecurityNumber`).

| `fields/field/type` (xref:#_field_type_options[details])
| Yes
| None
| The xref:dictionary-metamodel.adoc#_dictionary_type_options[dictionary type] of this field that provides simple type
as well as validation and advanced concepts.

| `fields/field/description`
| No
| None
| A description of the field.

| `fields/field/column`
| No
| None
| The name of the storage field for data persistence.

| `fields/field/required`
| No
| None
| Setting `required` to `true` will mandate that the field must be populated for a record to pass validation.

| `fields/field/driftPolicy`
| No
| Situational
| The default xref:drift-detection.adoc[drift detection] policy applied when this field is used. If a policy
is defined on the xref:dictionary-metamodel.adoc#_dictionary_type_options[type] for this field, specifying a policy on
the field will override the `driftPolicy` specified by the type.

| `fields/field/protectionPolicy`
| No
| Situational
| The default xref:data-encryption.adoc[data encryption] policy applied when this field is used. If a policy
is defined on the xref:dictionary-metamodel.adoc#_dictionary_type_options[type] for this field, specifying a policy on
the field will override the `protectionPolicy` specified by the type.

| `fields/field/ethicsPolicy`
| No
| Situational
| The default xref:bias-detection.adoc[bias detection] policy applied when this field is used. If a policy
is defined on the xref:dictionary-metamodel.adoc#_dictionary_type_options[type] for this field, specifying a policy on
the field will override the `ethicsPolicy` specified by the type.

| `fields/field/dataProfiling` (xref:_field_data_profiling_options[details])
| No
| Yes
| By default, xref:data-profiling-details.adoc[data profiling] is enabled for every field. Specifying this element allows
for data profiling to be disabled or enabled, if desired.
