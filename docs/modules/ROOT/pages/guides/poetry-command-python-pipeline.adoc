= Using Standalone Poetry for Python Pipeline Development

Python developers have the option to leverage standalone poetry to conveniently build and test modifications
without needing to run full Maven builds. With poetry, developers can build and test Python-based pipeline code within
the `<project_name>-pipelines` top-level directory.

When developers wish to execute tests they've written for a particular Python pipeline, they should run the command
`poetry run pytest` from within the `tests` directory of their pipeline. This command will execute the test suite and
provide feedback on the test results.

It's important to note that at present developers cannot directly execute Python code using the `poetry run` command
due to relative import issues. For example, running `poetry run python file_name.py` would result in failure.
