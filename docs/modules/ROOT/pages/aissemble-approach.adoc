= aiSSEMBLE(TM) Approach

aiSSEMBLE is a lean manufacturing approach for holistically designing, developing, and fielding AI. The aiSSEMBLE Baseline
is a framework which builds on the software and machine learning engineering best practices and lessons learned,
providing and maintaining reusable components, rather than a one-size-fits-all platform. In return, various members of
your team, including solution architects, DevOps engineers, data/software engineers, and AI/ML practitioners can easily
leverage these components to suit your business needs and integrate with any other tools that meet the needs of your
project.

== Baseline Fabrications
The Baseline represents the Factory component in the diagram below. aiSSEMBLE leverages
xref:aissemble-approach.adoc#_configurable_tooling[configurable tooling] in the fabrication process to generate key
scaffolding and other components that are tailored to your project. aiSSEMBLE also establishes a build process that
produces deployment-ready artifacts.

=== Configurable Tooling
With the fast-moving landscape of tools and techniques within AI, a process that can quickly change at the speed of AI
is needed. aiSSEMBLE understands it is crucial that the nuances of existing customer environments and preferences can be
incorporated into AI projects as an integral concept. The Baselineâ€™s Configurable Tooling is realized by using
https://www.omg.org/mda/[Model Driven Architecture,role=external,window=_blank] to describe your AI system with simple
JSON files. These files are then ingested to generate Python, Java, Scala, or any other type of file. Configurable
tooling exists for a vast array of components leveraging popular implementation choices, which can be used as-is or
tailored to specific needs.

=== Reusable Components
Reusable components represent the "ready-to-deploy" artifacts within aiSSEMBLE. These reusable components can be used in
a project directly. These include, but are not limited to, data lineage, AI model versioning, and bias detection.

== aiSSEMBLE Landscape
aiSSEMBLE is not a platform, but rather a framework that integrates with various technologies. The graphic below
demonstrates the representative set of technologies aiSSEMBLE integrates with. This set is always evolving to
keep pace with the rapidly changing AI space.
