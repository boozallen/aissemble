= Bias Detection

Bias detection, also known as Ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI), is concerned with determining if an AI model
systematically produces inaccurate results due to flawed assumptions. One contributing factor to model bias is the data
it learns from. By driving bias detection from a semantic data model, consistent bias detection policies are applied
throughout the data on the related field(s).
