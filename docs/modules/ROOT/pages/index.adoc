== Key Terms
* **aiSSEMBLE** – (pronounced assemble) is Booz Allen’s lean, manufacturing-inspired approach for holistically designing,
developing, and fielding AI solutions across the engineering lifecycle: from data processing (DataOps) to model building,
tuning, and training (ModelOps, MLOps), to secure operational deployment (DevSecOps).
* **https://github.com/boozallen/aissemble[aiSSEMBLE Baseline,role=external,window=_blank]** - An evolving,
versioned, core set of capabilities that can serve as an implementation's foundation, enabling the rapid standup of an
operational data delivery, data preparation, and/or machine learning (ML) pipelines.

== aiSSEMBLE Overview
[.lead]
The aiSSEMBLE Baseline is an accelerant that helps AI projects by leveraging pre-packaged and tailored
components, allowing a shift in focus towards value-added tasks, rather than labor-intensive, boilerplate tasks.

The Baseline also lowers the barrier for including features that are otherwise treated as nice-to-have items,
as teams often do not have time to incorporate them (e.g., drift detection, bias detection, provenance capture).

The Baseline is the key enabler for the aiSSEMBLE manufacturing process: a modern take on a holistic,
integrated lean software manufacturing process that can deliver a variety of AI products at high velocity. The graphic
below demonstrates the steps to kick off an aiSSEMBLE project.
