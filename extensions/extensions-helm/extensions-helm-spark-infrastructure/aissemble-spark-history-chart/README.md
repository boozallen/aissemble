# aiSSEMBLE&trade; Spark History Helm Chart

Baseline Helm chart for deploying the Spark History Server. Chart is built and managed during the normal Maven build
lifecycle and placed in the **target/helm/repo** directory. See https://github.com/kokuwaio/helm-maven-plugin for more
details.

# Basic usage with Helm CLI

To use the module, perform [extension-helm setup](../README.md#leveraging-extensions-helm) and override the chart
version with the desired aiSSEMBLE version. For example:

```bash
helm install spark-history oci://ghcr.io/boozallen/aissemble-spark-history-chart --version <AISSEMBLE-VERSION>
```

_**NOTE:**_ *the version should match the aiSSEMBLE project version.*

## Manually Creating a PersistentVolume

See the Kubernetes [PersistentVolume documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) for
more info. The PersistentVolume must have enough capacity to satisfy the PVC's `eventVolume.size` property. Consider
creating this PersistentVolume through a custom Helm chart so it can be easily redeployed and managed alongside the
Spark History Server. Additionally, if attempting to use the premade `PersistentVolumeClaim`,
the `eventVolume.storageType`
must be set to `custom`, and the `PersistentVolume` should be named `[eventVolume.name]-pv`.

## Dynamically Provisioning a PersistentVolume

If your Kubernetes cluster has a StorageClass that
can [dynamically provision](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning/)
PersistentVolumes, you can set the `eventVolume.storageClass` property to the name of the StorageClass. If you're using
Rancher Desktop and you don't want to enable cache persistence between deployments, it's possible to use Rancher's
Local Path Provisioner to dynamically create and destroy the cache by setting `eventVolume.storageClass` to `local-path`
and `eventVolume.storageType` to `custom`.

## Storing the Cache on the Node

This option is intended for use in development environments. By setting `ivyCache.storeCacheOnNode` to true, the chart
will create a PersistentVolume for you that maps to a local directory on the host machine of the Node. This directory
is defined by the `eventVolume.volumePathOnNode` property. This allows the Ivy cache to be reused between deployments.
Because the default location is in the `/tmp` directory, the cache may still be cleared between container restarts (e.g.
when restarting Rancher Desktop).

### Considerations

As noted, the local storage option is intended for development environments. This is due to the inherent security risk
of allowing a pod to access the host's filesystem. In many
environments, [`hostPath` volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath)
are disabled by default for this reason. Moreover, it's important to note that because hostPath and local volumes are
tied directly to a single Node, this functionality may not work as expected in mult-node environments.

It is possible to configure
the [Pod Security admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)
to allow hostPath volumes, either across the board or for Spark History Server pods specifically. Alternatively,
a [`local`
volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) can be used which alleviates most of the security
concerns as well as the single-node limitation. However, redeployments of the Spark Operator will not reuse the same
volume, meaning the cache will be lost between deployments.

# Migration from aiSSEMBLE v1 Helm Charts

If you are migrating from the v1 version of the spark-infrastructure chart, use the tables below to apply any
existing customizations from the old chart to the new v2 chart.

## Property Location

All properties listed below have been moved to the parent chart. If any properties are set to the default value, we
recommend removing them from your values file entirely.

**Note**: *all new property locations include the prefix `aissemble-spark-history-chart.`*

| Old Property Location | New Property Location | 
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| deployment.ports[]    | service.port          |
| service.spec.ports[]  | service.port          |

## Property Removed

No properties removed.
