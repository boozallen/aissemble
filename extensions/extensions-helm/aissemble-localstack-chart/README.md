# aiSSEMBLE&trade; Localstack Helm Chart

Baseline Helm chart for packaging and deploying localstack. The chart is built and managed during the normal Maven build
lifecycle and placed in the **target/helm/repo** directory.

For aiSSEMBLE-based projects, note that this chart is intended only for local development work, such as when deploying
via Tilt.

# Basic usage with Helm CLI

After building the module, perform [extension-helm setup](../README.md#leveraging-extensions-helm) and install the chart. For example:

```bash
helm install localstack ghcr.io/boozallen/aissemble-localstack-chart --version <AISSEMBLE-VERSION>
```

**Note**: *the version should match the aiSSEMBLE project version.*

# Overridden Defaults

*Note*
The localstack chart does not use a range of port definitions, it instead creates only one by default, the properties of
which are defined by aissemble-localstack.localstack.service.edgeService.[name | targetPort].
There is a new pair of properties named service.externalServicePorts.start and service.externalServicePorts.end that can
allow you to define a range of ports instead.
